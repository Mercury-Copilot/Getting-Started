# CI/CD Setup Guide

Automate your development workflow with our CI/CD pipeline. We use [specific tool, e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, CircleCI].

## Key Steps

1. **Pipeline Overview**
   - Stages: Build → Test → Deploy.
   - Tools: [CI/CD tool used].
   - All workflows are defined in the `.github/workflows` (or respective CI/CD directory).

2. **Setup CI/CD**
   - Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone <repo-url>
     ```
   - Navigate to the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd <project-name>
     ```
   - Ensure you have access to the CI/CD platform (e.g., GitHub Actions).

3. **How to Add a New Workflow**
   - Add a `.yml` file in `.github/workflows/`:
     ```yml
     name: CI Pipeline
     on:
       push:
         branches:
           - main
     jobs:
       build:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest
         steps:
           - uses: actions/checkout@v2
           - name: Install dependencies
             run: npm install
           - name: Run tests
             run: npm test
     ```

4. **Best Practices**
   - Use caching to speed up builds (e.g., dependency caching).
   - Set up notifications for failed builds.
   - Use environment-specific workflows for staging and production.

5. **Debugging Pipelines**
   - Access CI logs directly from the CI/CD dashboard.
   - Test individual stages locally using tools like `act` (for GitHub Actions).
